# ReminderListApp
My first MVVM and MVI app! 

**In this app i tried several parts of android:**
1. Notifications (creating channels for them and using them in service)
2. MVVM pattern (i didnt use viewmodels in right places in prev projects)
3. A bit of design (that floating button + date/time picker that came from one github)

This app however lacks design, but with it it will be complete.
How app works:
1. **Alarm List Screen:**
   - Upon entering the app, you'll see a list of your alarms. If it's your first time, the list will be empty.
   - You can add or delete alarms from this screen.

2. **Add Alarm Screen:**
   - If you choose to add more alarms, this screen will guide you through the process.
   - Start by entering the name of the alarm.
   - Use the calendar-like date setter and a clock-like time setter to choose the date and time, including distinguishing between AM and PM.

3. **Notification:**
   - Once you set the time, you'll receive a notification.

That's it! The app is designed for simple and efficient alarm management.

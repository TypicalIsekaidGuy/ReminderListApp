# ReminderListApp
My first MVVM and MVI app! 

**In this app i tried several parts of android:**
1. Notifications (creating channels for them and using them in service)
2. MVVM pattern (i didnt use viewmodels in right places in prev projects)
3. A bit of design (that floating button + date/time picker that came from one github)

This app however lacks design, but with it it will be complete.
